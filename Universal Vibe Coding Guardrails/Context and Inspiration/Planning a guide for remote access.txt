I want to use my home fibre internet also when Im away and cant connect to wifi hotspot, but can still access it using the phones mobile broadband or something. Im in South Africa and my ISP is Vuma Tel:

Great goal: you want to access your home fibre connection remotely, even when you’re away and can’t rely on your home Wi‑Fi hotspot. Since you’re in South Africa with Vuma Tel as your ISP, here are practical options and steps, from simplest to more advanced. I’ll cover both remote access to the home network and using mobile data as a failover or remote access path.

Overview of viable approaches

VPN into your home network
Remote access to devices at home (NAS, PC) via VPN or remote desktop
Expose services selectively (with strong security) if needed
Mobile data tethering as a backup or alternative access path
Considerations for South Africa: data costs, ISP terms, static IP vs dynamic DNS, 4G/LTE considerations
Important prerequisites and terms

Public IP: Does your Vuma Tel connection provide a static public IP, or a dynamic one? Many residential Fibre connections assign a dynamic public IP that changes periodically.
Modem/Router capabilities: Do you have a router at home that supports VPN server functionality (e.g., OpenVPN, WireGuard) or a dedicated VPN router?
Dynamic DNS (DDNS): If you have a dynamic IP, a DDNS service can map a stable hostname to your home IP.
Security: Exposing remote access services to the internet can be risky. Use VPN as a secure tunnel rather than exposing ports directly.
Recommended solution path

Set up a VPN server at home
Best practice: Run a VPN server at home (OpenVPN or WireGuard) on a device that’s always on (a home PC, a NAS, or a dedicated VPN router if you have one).
Benefits: You get secure access to your home network from anywhere, and you can reach devices as if you were on your home network.
What you need:
A device at home able to run the VPN server 24/7 (e.g., a Raspberry Pi, a small NAS, or your home router if it supports VPN server).
A VPN server software (OpenVPN or WireGuard). WireGuard is simpler and faster but may require more manual setup on some consumer devices.
Port forwarding on your home router to the VPN server (e.g., UDP 1194 for OpenVPN or the WireGuard port you choose).
A dynamic DNS service if your public IP is dynamic (e.g., DuckDNS, Afraid.org, or a DDNS provider supported by your router).
Clients on your mobile devices: the WireGuard or OpenVPN client apps.
Security tips:
Use strong keys/cairs; use TLS for OpenVPN or pre-shared keys for WireGuard.
Disable admin access from the internet; only allow VPN.
Regularly update firmware/software.
Steps (high-level):
Install VPN server on a local device.
Configure VPN users/keys.
Set up port forwarding on your Vuma router to the VPN server.
Set up Dynamic DNS if IP is dynamic.
Install VPN client on your mobile phone; connect when away.
Test connectivity from a mobile network (not Wi-Fi) to confirm the tunnel works.
Access home devices over VPN
Once connected to the VPN, you’ll be on your home network.
You can access:
Remote desktop (RDP/VNC) to a PC.
NAS services (file shares, Plex, etc.) if you expose them via VPN.
Home automation hubs, printers, and other devices as needed.
If you need a browser-based remote access to a single device, you could run a secure remote access service behind the VPN (e.g., a web interface over HTTPS with MFA), but VPN is typically simpler and more secure.
Optional: Remote desktop alternatives without VPN
If setting up a VPN is too complex, you could use a remote desktop solution that is port-forwarded through a VPN-like tunnel (e.g., a remote administration tool). However, keep in mind this is less secure and often not recommended unless you know what you’re doing.
If you already have a cloud-based storage or NAS service (e.g., Synology QuickConnect, or QNAP myQNAPcloud), some offer easier remote access, but these still rely on their own servers and may not give you full network access.
Use mobile data as a fallback
If your goal is simply to access your home internet when you’re away (i.e., browse as if you’re at home), a VPN is still the most robust solution; you’d connect via mobile data to your home VPN.
If you just need internet access while away, you can tether your phone to a laptop or use a portable Wi-Fi hotspot, but that defeats the purpose of using your home fibre.
If you have a business plan for remote workers, a hosted VPN service or SD-WAN appliance at home or in a data center could be considered, but that’s usually overkill for a home setup.
Practical steps to implement (concrete checklist)

Confirm your home router/firewall supports VPN
If yes, check for built-in OpenVPN or WireGuard support.
If no, consider a small dedicated device (Raspberry Pi) to host the VPN.
Decide on VPN type
WireGuard: simpler, fast, modern. Recommended if supported.
OpenVPN: very mature, widely supported.
Dynamic DNS
Pick a DDNS provider and configure your router or VPN server to update it automatically.
Create a hostname like myhomevpn.ddns.net.
Port forwarding
Forward the VPN port (e.g., UDP 51820 for WireGuard, UDP 1194 for OpenVPN) to the VPN server device.
Client setup
Install WireGuard or OpenVPN client on your phone.
Import the client configuration from your server.
Test connection from mobile network (not Wi-Fi).
Security hardening
Use strong encryption, rotate keys, disable unused services.
Keep firmware up to date on all devices.
Consider firewall rules to only allow VPN traffic from known sources if possible.
South Africa-specific notes

Data costs: Mobile data can be expensive; use the VPN primarily for access rather than high-bandwidth activity unless you’re on a generous plan.
IPv6 considerations: If your home ISP assigns IPv6, you can run IPv6 VPN; otherwise stick to IPv4 with DDNS.
Support: Check if Vuma Tel’s router allows enabling DMZ or port forwarding, and whether your rental modem has built-in VPN server capability.
What I need from you to tailor this precisely

Do you have a router at home with VPN capabilities (OpenVPN/WireGuard) or would you need to install a small device like a Raspberry Pi?
Is your public IP dynamic or static? If you’re not sure, I can help you check.
Do you already use Dynamic DNS, or would you like recommendations for a provider?
Are you comfortable with networking steps (port forwarding, firewall rules) or would you prefer a more user-friendly, possibly commercial, solution?

Provide a step-by-step, device-specific guide (e.g., for a TP-Link/Netgear/ASUS router with OpenVPN/WireGuard,) once user share which hardware they’re using.

**Planning a guide for remote access**

The user seems technical and based in Durban, which I’ll keep in mind, especially with mobile data costs. They want a detailed yet straightforward guide, so I think I'll focus on networking rather than full code examples. I’ll provide commands for installing WireGuard on Raspberry Pi, Windows, and mobile devices—keeping it clear and concise. I don’t need to use LaTeX, and I’ll avoid a table since it’s not really necessary. I’ll use bullet points with bold labels and keep the sections precise and actionable. I'll also include troubleshooting steps to make it more complete.
### Remote access to your home fibre in South Africa

You want to reach your home network and use your fibre connection when you’re away, even if you can’t connect to your home Wi‑Fi. The cleanest path is a home VPN that you connect to over mobile data. Below is a practical, secure setup tailored for South Africa and Vumatel-backed fibre.

### Key constraints in South Africa to verify first

- **Public IP vs CGNAT:** Many residential lines sit behind carrier‑grade NAT. If you’re behind CGNAT, inbound connections won’t work without a workaround.  
  - **How to check:** On a device at home, Google “what is my IP.” Compare that public IP with your router’s WAN IP.  
    - **Match:** You have a public IP; port forwarding will work.  
    - **Mismatch (router shows 10.x/100.64.x/192.168.x/172.16–31.x):** You’re behind CGNAT. Ask your ISP for a public IP or use a reverse tunnel/cloud relay.
- **ONT vs router:** Vumatel typically provides an ONT; your own router handles NAT/firewall.  
  - **Action:** Confirm your router model and whether it supports a built‑in VPN server (WireGuard/OpenVPN).
- **Data considerations:** Mobile data in SA can be pricey. Keep your VPN usage focused (RDP/SSH/file access) and avoid streaming through it unless needed.

### Recommended path: WireGuard home VPN

#### Option A: Use your router’s built‑in VPN (simplest)
- **Check support:** Look for WireGuard or OpenVPN in VPN Server settings on ASUS, MikroTik, TP‑Link, or Netgear routers.
- **Enable and configure:**
  - **Server:** Turn on WireGuard server, generate keys, and define a VPN subnet (e.g., 10.6.0.0/24).
  - **Peers:** Create a peer for your phone; export the config/QR code.
  - **Port:** Use UDP 51820. If the router is the edge device, you don’t need extra port forwards.
- **DDNS:** Enable your router’s DDNS (e.g., myhome123.tplinkdns.com) so your phone can connect even if your public IP changes.

#### Option B: Run WireGuard on a Raspberry Pi or always‑on PC
- **Prepare the device:**
  - **Raspberry Pi (Debian/Raspberry Pi OS):**
    - Install:  
      ```
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install wireguard
      ```
    - Generate keys:  
      ```
      umask 077
      wg genkey | tee /etc/wireguard/server_private.key | wg pubkey > /etc/wireguard/server_public.key
      wg genkey | tee ~/phone_private.key | wg pubkey > ~/phone_public.key
      ```
    - Create server config `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`:  
      ```
      [Interface]
      Address = 10.6.0.1/24
      ListenPort = 51820
      PrivateKey = <server_private_key>
      SaveConfig = true

      # Allow VPN clients to access your LAN and internet via home fibre
      PostUp = iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
      PostDown = iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
      ```
    - Enable on boot:  
      ```
      sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
      sudo systemctl start wg-quick@wg0
      ```
  - **Windows PC (always‑on):**
    - Install WireGuard app (official).
    - Create a tunnel with server role using the same addressing (10.6.0.1/24) and port 51820.
    - Enable “Allowed IPs” and Windows firewall rules for UDP 51820 inbound.

- **Add your phone peer:**
  - On server, append to `wg0.conf`:  
    ```
    [Peer]
    PublicKey = <phone_public_key>
    AllowedIPs = 10.6.0.2/32
    ```
  - Phone config (to import in WireGuard app):  
    ```
    [Interface]
    Address = 10.6.0.2/32
    PrivateKey = <phone_private_key>
    DNS = 10.6.0.1

    [Peer]
    PublicKey = <server_public_key>
    Endpoint = your-ddns-name:51820
    AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
    PersistentKeepalive = 25
    ```
  - Use `AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0` if you want all traffic to go via home fibre; otherwise, use your LAN ranges only (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) for split‑tunnel.

### Dynamic DNS and port forwarding

- **DDNS:** Set up a hostname on your router (e.g., ASUS DDNS, TP‑Link DDNS) or use DuckDNS/No‑IP on the Pi.  
  - **Goal:** Your phone connects to `hostname:51820`.
- **Port forward:** If the VPN runs on a Pi/PC behind the router:  
  - **Rule:** Forward UDP 51820 from WAN to the Pi/PC’s local IP.  
  - **Double NAT warning:** If you have a second router, forward on both or put the inner router in DMZ from the outer.

---

### Mobile client setup and testing

- **Install apps:** WireGuard on Android or iOS.
- **Import config:** Use QR or file; set your DDNS hostname as the endpoint.
- **Test over mobile data:** Disable Wi‑Fi on the phone, connect the VPN, then:
  - **Ping test:** Ping a LAN device (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
  - **Service test:** RDP/SSH to your home PC/NAS.  
  - **Full‑tunnel test:** Visit “what is my IP.” If it shows your home ISP, your traffic routes through home fibre.

---

### Security hardening and safe exposure

- **Strong keys:** Regenerate if keys were ever shared; keep private keys off cloud storage.
- **Firewall:** Allow only UDP 51820 from WAN; block admin UI from internet.  
- **Updates:** Keep router/OS firmware up to date.  
- **MFA for services:** If you expose any web UI internally, keep them behind the VPN; don’t port‑forward them directly.
- **Access rules:** Use split‑tunnel if you only need home LAN access, to reduce mobile data usage.

---

### Troubleshooting checklist

- **CGNAT:** If port forwarding doesn’t work and WAN IP is private/doesn’t match public IP, request a public IP from your ISP or use a reverse tunnel service.  
- **Wrong interface names:** On Pi, ensure `eth0` matches your WAN interface; on some devices it’s `wan0` or `enx…`.  
- **DNS leaks:** If names don’t resolve, set DNS in client to the router or Pi (or 1.1.1.1) and retest.  
- **MTU issues:** If connections are flaky, set `MTU = 1280` in WireGuard interface.  
- **Double NAT:** Put your router in bridge mode or use DMZ on the upstream device.  
- **Firewall rules:** Confirm Windows Defender or router firewall allows UDP 51820 inbound.

### What I need from you to tailor the steps

- **Router model:** The exact make/model you use behind the Vumatel ONT.  
- **Public IP status:** Does your router’s WAN IP match the IP reported by “what is my IP”?  
- **Preferred setup:** Router VPN vs Raspberry Pi/PC.  
- **Traffic needs:** Full‑tunnel (browse via home fibre) or split‑tunnel (only access LAN devices).
