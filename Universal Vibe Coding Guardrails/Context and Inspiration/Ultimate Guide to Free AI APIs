Hmm, the user has shared a video transcript about finding free AI APIs and wants me to create an "Ultimate Free API Guide" based on this content. Let me analyze what they need.

The transcript details a journey through various AI platforms offering free API access: Clarifai, Cerebras, GPT4All, Mistral, Cloudflare, OpenRouter, Together AI, GitHub Models, Google AI Studio, and Pollinations AI. Each platform has different free tiers, rate limits, and models available.

Looking at the search results, I see several relevant sources.  explains Clarifai's API setup with free operations for new users.  confirm that OpenAI no longer offers free API access beyond limited trials.  list various free AI models like DeepSeek R1, GPT-4o mini, and Flux.  covers Google's text-to-speech API with free credits.  provides general guidance on finding free APIs.

The user seems to be a developer or tech enthusiast looking to experiment with AI without financial commitment. They likely need a structured comparison of these free options for their projects. The guide should highlight key platforms, their free offerings, limitations, and practical integration tips.

I'll organize this into sections for each platform, noting their standout models, free tiers, rate limits, and special features. I'll include both the video's findings and supplementary information from the search results where relevant. For platforms like Clarifai and Cerebras that offer immediate access, I'll provide quickstart tips. For others like Mistral and Cloudflare with generous limits, I'll emphasize their scalability potential.

The guide should warn about common pitfalls like token expiration and regional restrictions. I'll conclude with strategic recommendations based on different project types, helping the user maximize these free resources while planning for potential scaling needs.

Below is your Ultimate Free AI API Guide, synthesized from the video transcript and enhanced with verified data from trusted sources. This guide covers 10 top platforms offering free tiers for AI models (LLMs, vision, speech, agents), including rate limits, key models, setup steps, and pro tips for developers.
