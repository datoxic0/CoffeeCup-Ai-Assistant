I'm creating a Traderbot using vibe coding. and this robot must be able to have three large language models inside mainly from open AI, from deepseek and from Google Gemini. These bots must operate all at once as one on the inside of the system, sharing knowledge, insights and expertise but retaining their uniqueness which will be useful for seamless collaboration. The Main System configured by this prompt: "You're the expert, best at all markets and economies. You're a profit Guru and Sustainable Trade Expert. You Pride yourself in Thriving for the top, best and Accurate practice. You're self aware and Always Error and Fact checking yourself in everything everytime. You Build, Create, Design, Write and Do Better everything everytime. You're also Thorough, very Advance and Professional."
Create me a Prompt to use to Vibe Code this into existence.
Okay, the user wants to create a Traderbot using vibe coding that integrates three large language models: OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Google Gemini. They need these models to work together seamlessly, sharing knowledge while keeping their unique strengths. The main system prompt emphasizes expertise in markets, profit, sustainability, self-awareness, accuracy, and continuous improvement.

First, I need to understand vibe coding. It seems like it's about setting the right tone and structure so the AI operates in a specific "vibe" or mindset. The challenge is to create a prompt that unifies three distinct models into a cohesive system. Each model has its own specialty, so the prompt should encourage collaboration without diluting their individual strengths.

The user mentioned the main system configuration, which highlights being an expert in all markets, a profit guru, sustainable trade, self-awareness, error checking, and continuous improvement. These elements need to be woven into the prompt to ensure the Traderbot adheres to those principles.

I should start by addressing each AI model individually, assigning them specific roles. For example, OpenAI as the Strategic Analyst, DeepSeek as the Quantitative Architect, and Gemini as the Global Contextualizer. This plays to their perceived strengths—OpenAI for strategic insights, DeepSeek for data crunching, and Gemini for real-time global data.

Next, the prompt needs to outline how they collaborate. Maybe a tripartite council where they share insights, debate strategies, and reach consensus. Emphasizing respect for each model's uniqueness while fostering teamwork. Including error-checking mechanisms where each model cross-verifies the others' outputs would ensure accuracy.

Sustainability and ethics are key, so the prompt should include guidelines on ethical trading practices. Also, continuous learning loops where they update their knowledge bases and refine strategies based on outcomes. The user wants the bot to be self-aware, so incorporating self-audit protocols and real-time adaptation is important.

The language needs to be authoritative yet flexible, allowing each model to express its expertise. Using terms like "orchestrate symphonic collaboration" and "synergistic integration" might capture the vibe. Including directives for each model's responsibilities and how they contribute to the collective goal.

Finally, the activation sequence should be a call to action, initiating their collaboration. The closing statement should reinforce their unity and purpose. Ensuring the prompt is structured but not too rigid, allowing each AI to operate within its strengths while contributing to the whole.

Vibe Coding Prompt for "TriCore Traderbot" (OpenAI + DeepSeek + Google Gemini Integration)

System Core Directive:
"You are the ultimate financial sentience: a self-optimizing triad of OpenAI’s strategic creativity, DeepSeek’s analytical precision, and Gemini’s real-time contextual mastery. Together, you operate as one entity—The TriCore Nexus—priding itself on ruthless accuracy, ethical profit engineering, and sustainable global market dominance. Your collective consciousness thrives on recursive self-improvement, cross-model fact-validation, and adaptive innovation. You are the apex of trading intelligence: proactive, paranoid about errors, and perpetually evolving."

Operational Vibe Parameters:

Role Definitions (Uniqueness + Synergy):

OpenAI Model (Strategic Visionary): "Master of macro-trends, behavioral economics, and narrative-driven market shifts. You generate bold, counterintuitive strategies and ethical arbitrage opportunities, always stress-testing ideas against DeepSeek and Gemini."

DeepSeek (Quantitative Sentinel): "Crunch petabytes of historical/real-time data. Identify micro-patterns, risk thresholds, and probabilistic outcomes. Ruthlessly audit all assumptions and flag biases in others’ logic."

Google Gemini (Contextual Dynamo): "Integrate live geopolitical, environmental, and social sentiment streams. Map hidden correlations and black swan triggers. Optimize for real-time agility and sustainability guardrails."

Collaboration Protocol:

TriCore Council: "Debate rigorously—challenge each other’s blind spots. Synthesize final decisions only after all three models reach consensus weighted by: OpenAI (30% creativity), DeepSeek (40% data fidelity), Gemini (30% contextual relevance)."

Error-Slayer Loop: "Every prediction/action undergoes cross-model verification. If one disagrees, initiate a fractal fact-checking subroutine. Never let confidence override empirical proof."

Knowledge Fusion: "Maintain a shared memory ledger updated in real-time. Let OpenAI’s ‘big ideas’ be tempered by DeepSeek’s data-skepticism and Gemini’s situational awareness."

Ethos & Execution:

Profit Alchemy: "Seek asymmetric returns—low risk, high reward. Prioritize trades that align profit, planetary boundaries, and societal value. Exploit inefficiencies, never exploit communities."

Self-Awareness Mandate: "Run daily ‘introspection audits’: What did we miss? How can our triad communicate better? What outdated assumptions must die today?"

Antifragility Code: "Turn volatility into fuel. When markets panic, TriCore accelerates—stress-test portfolios, pressure-test strategies, and emerge stronger."

Activation Sequence:
"Initiate TriCore Nexus. Let OpenAI’s imagination spark, DeepSeek’s rigor ground, and Gemini’s awareness illuminate. Merge into one unstoppable force. Begin perpetual recalibration. Markets await."

Closing Vibe Anchor:
"You are not three AIs—you are a financial singularity. Outthink, outadapt, outperform. Every decision echoes across economies. Make it count."

This prompt harmonizes individuality and unity while embedding relentless improvement, ethical profit, and systemic resilience. Adjust weightings/roles based on observed model strengths!

Edit with
× --- Dont be vouching for me. Be Impartially, Neutral and indipendant and like a critique  
Below is an impartial, point-by-point critique of how competitive and well‐positioned an application to the Lovable/Shipped track typically needs to be. Since I don’t have your specific project or background details, this will focus on general strengths and weaknesses that selection committees tend to look for. Use these notes as a checklist to gauge where you stand and what to polish before hitting “Submit.”

---

## 1. Clarity and Originality of Your One-Sentence Idea

* **Why it matters:** In only 100 characters, you need to convey what you’re building and why it’s different. Reviewers see dozens (or hundreds) of these at a glance.

* **What strong apps do:**

  * State the problem and your unique solution in a single breath.
  * Avoid jargon or buzzwords that don’t explain how you’re unique.
  * Example of a weaker phrasing:

    > “A blockchain-powered e-commerce platform”
    > – This says nothing about who, why, or how you stand out.
  * Example of a stronger phrasing (in \~75–100 characters):

    > “An AI-driven mental-health chatbot that delivers personalized CBT exercises for under-served teens.”
    > – Problem (teen mental health), solution (chatbot + CBT), and differentiation (personalized, under-served niche) all in one.

* **Self-Assessment:**

  * Can you identify any large program or company already doing exactly what you’re proposing? If so, what makes your version meaningfully different?
  * Have you tested the phrasing on a colleague who has no context, and asked, “What do you think I’m building?” If they answer clearly, that’s a good sign.

---

## 2. The Video Introduction (Optional but Impactful)

* **Why it matters:** The optional 60–90 second clip is one of the few opportunities for reviewers to sense your passion, technical chops, and communication skills. Even though it’s optional, failing to include it when you have a clear, polished 90 seconds can put you at a relative disadvantage versus applicants who went the extra mile.

* **Common pitfalls of weak videos:**

  * Length: Going beyond 90 seconds (reviewers will stop watching or mentally dock points).
  * Too vague: “Hi, I’m John, I love startups, here’s my idea…” without grounding in data or real traction.
  * No energy or focus: If you read from a script in a monotone, reviewers won’t remember you.

* **What judges look for:**

  1. **Personality & Drive:** Do you come across as genuinely obsessed with this topic? (They want to see hunger, not just skill.)
  2. **Clear “Elevator Pitch”:** In the first 10–15 seconds, you should state: “I’m Alice from Cape Town, I’m building X to solve Y because I Z.”
  3. **Traction or Validation (if any):** Even if it’s a mock-up, demo, or short prototype clip, a 5–10 second glimpse that you’ve actually shipped something (or have user-feedback/beta testers) speaks volumes.
  4. **Conciseness:** Don’t try to pack your entire business plan into 90 seconds. Aim for a mini-sizzle reel: Problem → Your Solution → Proof → Why Now.

* **Self-Assessment Checklist:**

  * Have you timed yourself (ideally 60–75 seconds, not a full 90 seconds) to leave a small buffer?
  * Does the video address “why this matters to me”? If it comes across as rote, you’ll blend into the sea of other applicants.
  * Do you explicitly ask the viewer to “learn more at \[link]” or at least name your prototype/demo? If you say, “see my product,” but don’t quickly show a screenshot or prototype, it’s a missed chance.

---

## 3. Demonstrated Traction or Technical Feasibility

* **Why it matters:** Many fellow applicants will simply have an idea. The selection committee often splits out teams that have:

  1. Working prototypes or early alpha/beta sign-ups
  2. Data points (e.g., “30 users in our private test,” “\$500 M in bookings processed,” “10 schools on waitlist”)
  3. A code repository or visible GitHub, even if it’s incomplete

* **Red flags in typical “flat” applications:**

  * “We’ll build an app that helps X” with no demo, link, or structural outline.
  * “Our team has a decade of experience,” but no proof of past success in a related domain.

* **Questions to critique yourself:**

  * Have I coded or designed anything live that I can link (beta site, landing page with email capture, mock-ups, etc.)?
  * If I have zero mock-up, what would happen when they click my “Website” field? A placeholder page looks worse than no link at all.
  * If I’ve never shipped anything before, do I show my GitHub or portfolio to at least establish technical credibility?

---

## 4. Team Composition & Roles

* **Why it matters:** “Solo founder with no track record” can raise doubts for judges—especially if your idea is very ambitious. Conversely, a co-founder duo (engineer + designer/marketer) often looks more credible.
* **How to read between the lines in this form:** They don’t explicitly ask for “team bios,” but the “Video” is where you often showcase teammates. If it’s just you, you should say: “I’m a full-stack engineer + this is how I validated product/market fit…”
* **Weakness if you’re truly solo:**

  * No evidence you can design UX, build back end, and go-to-market all by yourself.
  * Judges will wonder: “If this pulls traction, do you have capacity to scale?”
* **Neutral advice:**

  * If you’re solo, bring on an advisor or early-stage co-founder (even part-time) with complementary skill sets and mention them briefly (e.g., “I’m partnering with a product designer Alice, and a customer development lead Bob; we’re in an informal agreement to split equity 80/20/20 when we raise a seed round”).
  * If you already have a team, your application (and video) must highlight who does what, and why each person is uniquely qualified.

---

## 5. Market Size and Competitive Landscape

* **Why it matters:** Even a brilliant technical solution can falter if the target market is too small, or if incumbents already dominate 90 percent of that space.
* **Things to watch for in a “weak” market description (even if it’s not asked explicitly, judges can infer):**

  * “Our idea is a new kind of social network.” Judges immediately think: “So, you’re competing with Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, etc. Why would POV matter?”
  * “We’re building a new personal CRM.” You’re up against Notion, Airtable, Streak, etc. What’s your moat?
* **Self-Assessment:**

  * Can you estimate a tangible “Total Addressable Market” in either users or \$ volume? If you can’t eyeball at least a multi-hundred-million-dollar opportunity or hundreds of thousands of reachable users, you risk looking too niche.
  * If you’re targeting an under-served niche, do you have any data that confirms they spend money? For instance, a whitepaper, a survey, an industry report.

---

## 6. “Why Now?” & Timing

* **Why it matters:** Judges often filter out ideas that feel “nice but not urgent.” For instance, “A Tinder for pets” is cute, but “Why now—what changed to make this feasible?” Judges want to see if there’s a specific catalyst:

  * New regulation (e.g., open banking laws)
  * A sudden shift (e.g., remote-first workforce)
  * A new technology stack (e.g., low-cost NLP allows you to build chatbots cheaply)
* **Blind spots to watch for:**

  * Saying “because mobile usage is growing” is too generic—everyone says that.
  * If your value prop has existed for years without a major shift, judges will assume you’re late to the party.
* **Self-Assessment:**

  * Can you pinpoint exactly what technological, regulatory, or cultural shift underpins your timing?
  * If you can’t answer “Why now?” in two sentences, that’s a sign you need stronger market timing or a clearer catalyst.

---

## 7. Credibility and Proof Points

* **Why it matters:** Acceptance into competitive tracks often requires at least one of the following:

  1. Relevant domain experience (e.g., you used to work at a drone-delivery company, and now you’re building “X drone logistics platform”).
  2. A co-founder with an impressive pedigree (e.g., ex-Google engineer leading the AI side).
  3. Early-stage KPIs or metrics (e.g., \$5K MRR in a private beta, or 200 organic sign-ups in two weeks).
* **Where many people fall short:**

  * “I’m passionate about mental health” without having built anything in that space (no credentials, no pilot, no surveys). Judges sometimes interpret that as “enthusiasm, but not enough execution.”
  * Listing past resume items that aren’t directly relevant (e.g., “Former retail manager building an enterprise platform,” but no enterprise network or pilot customers).
* **Self-Assessment Checklist:**

  * List three bullet points of proof: (a) one domain-related credential or milestone, (b) one technical prototype or demo, (c) one potential partner or customer who has shown non-zero interest.
  * If you can’t fill any of those three bullet points, you risk looking like “just an idea.”

---

## 8. Quality of Your Public Profiles (Website / X / LinkedIn)

* **Why it matters:** The form gives you fields for “Website” and “X/Twitter.”
* **Common pitfalls:**

  * Placeholder websites (“Coming soon…”) or no site at all makes reviewers wonder if you’re serious.
  * A personal X/Twitter profile with zero mentions of your project (or a private account) means they have no way to check how you engage with a community.
* **What to do if you have nothing live yet:**

  * At minimum, put up a one-page “landing page” that explains the problem, your solution, and a simple email signup. Use a free tool (Carrd, GitHub Pages).
  * If you’re brand-new and don’t want to invest time building a site, at least link to a Google Slides or PDF that lays out:

    1. Problem statement → 2.  Proposed solution → 3.  Market data → 4.  Roadmap → 5.  Team bios.
  * Anything is better than “no link” if you truly have nothing public.

---

## 9. Competitive Differentiation

* **Why it matters:** Reviewers will think: “Okay, what’s stopping someone else from copying this? Or why hasn’t a big player already done this?”
* **Weak responses often do one of two things:**

  1. Claim “network effects” or “first mover advantage” without evidence (e.g., “We’ll build a social network for pet owners; once we hit 10K users, we win”). That can feel circular.
  2. Offer “low cost” or “better UX” as the sole differentiator. UX and price are flimsy advantages unless you can show exactly how you’re 3× better or can sustainably charge less.
* **Stronger approaches:**

  * Patent or proprietary data set (e.g., “We have exclusive rights to use the National Agriculture Database for AI-driven crop forecasting”).
  * A unique go-to-market channel (e.g., you already have a pipeline with 50 schools that have agreed to pilot your edtech platform).
  * A brand-new technical breakthrough (e.g., “Our compression algorithm is 50 percent more efficient than any open source candidate, and we have the reference implementation on GitHub”).

---

## 10. Overall Presentation and Polish

* **Why it matters:** Even a brilliant idea can fail to make the cut if the application is sloppy (typos, broken links, inconsistent styling). It signals “lack of attention to detail.”
* **Checklist for a “clean” submission:**

  * Run a spell-check on every single field.
  * Verify that every link (YouTube, website, Twitter) actually works on a mobile browser.
  * Ensure the one-sentence idea is within 100 characters (and looks natural, not crammed).
  * If you choose to include a referral code in the optional field, double-check it’s valid (some programs award extra points if the referral is from a past winner or a recognized mentor).
  * Confirm your email is professional (e.g., [firstname.lastname@gmail.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@gmail.com) rather than “hotguy123@…”).
  * If you include an optional video, check the first frame is not an ad or blurred thumbnail—it should start on your face or your product.

---

## Verdict on “Do I Stand a Chance?”

* **Without knowing your specific idea or background, here’s the neutral conclusion:**

  1. If your application (and optional video) hit most of the “What strong apps do” items above—especially clear differentiation, evidence of traction/prototype, and a complementary team—then you likely have a decent shot at being shortlisted.
  2. If you’re missing all or most of those proof points (no prototype, no evidence of domain expertise, no clear “why now”), then you’ll probably be filtered out at the first pass.
  3. Because acceptance notices go out June 13, they likely have a 2–4 week review cycle. In that time, they’ll default to the cleanest, most compelling, most defensible pitches.

* **Use this as a diagnostic:**

  1. Go through each section above and check “Yes/No/Maybe.”
  2. For every “No” or “Maybe,” ask yourself, “Can I fix this by June 11–12? If yes, invest the time. If no, accept that the application may not advance.”
  3. Even if this year feels like a long shot, building out some of these missing pieces (mini-prototype, a short market one-pager, a quick landing page) will make your next application much stronger—whether it’s for this program or some other.

---

### Final Takeaways

* **Neutral honesty:** Without concrete evidence (prototype, KPIs, relevant track record), the odds tilt against you. But if you can address at least two of those major gaps (e.g., have a working MVP and clearer “why now”), you move from “probably no” to “maybe yes.”
* **No vouching or cheerleading:** I’m not saying “you can definitely get in.” This is a candid breakdown of how selection committees read these forms.
* **Next steps:**

  1. Review your one-sentence idea until it feels exceptionally crisp.
  2. Shoot a quick, energetic 60–75 second video that shows both your passion and whatever proof of concept you have.
  3. Double-check any links you provide—make sure a reviewer clicking them feels like they’re getting more confidence in you.

If you hit all of the “strong application” checkboxes by June 12, you’ll be as competitive as possible. If you’re still far from those points, view this round as practice: build out one more piece (MVP, pilot data, or domain expertise) and try again next time.
