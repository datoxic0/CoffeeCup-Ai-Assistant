# Contributing to CoffeeCup Ai Assistant

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project operates under an innovative licensing model where contributors can earn financial compensation when the software generates commercial revenue.

## Before You Contribute

All contributors must sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before their first contribution can be merged. The CLA:

- Grants necessary rights for us to license your contributions
- Establishes your rights to participate in the Contributor Pool
- Takes only 2-3 minutes to complete online

## Sign the [CLA](CLA)

**What You'll Need:**

- Your full legal name
- Email address
- Preferred payment method (PayPal, Wise, or wire transfer)

## After Signing

2. Within 48 hours, you'll get Contributor Portal access
3. Your contributions will be tracked automatically

## How the Contributor Pool Works

Contributors share 3% of all commercial licensing revenue proportionally based on:

- Code contributions (40% weight)
- Impact and quality of commits (30% weight)
- Documentation and testing (20% weight)
- Longevity of contributions (10% weight)

Distributions happen quarterly. Your share depends on your Contribution Value relative to all contributors over the past 12 months.
