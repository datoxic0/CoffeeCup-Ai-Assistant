Copyright (c) 2025 Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi and The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated

All rights reserved.

## Preamble

This License grants broad rights for non-commercial use of the software source code. Commercial and enterprise uses are permitted only under a separate commercial license that requires payment of royalties as described below. This License implements an equitable model that rewards not only the original developer and supporting organizations but also the community of contributors who enhance and improve the software. This License is a source-available license and not an OSI-approved open-source license because it reserves the right to require a commercial license and royalty payment for commercial and enterprise deployment.

## 1. Definitions

**1.1. Licensed Software** means the source code, binaries, documentation, and other materials expressly identified as being licensed under this License.

**1.2. You / Licensee** means any person or entity that exercises rights under this License.

**1.3. Non-Commercial Use** means use, reproduction, modification, distribution, or display of the Licensed Software that is not primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage, monetary compensation, or commercial deployment. Examples include personal projects, academic research, open research, non-profit activities, internal evaluation, and internal testing conducted without revenue generation.

**1.4. Commercial Use** means any use of the Licensed Software that: (a) is for or results in monetary compensation, revenue, fundraising, or other direct or indirect commercial advantage; (b) deploys the software in production as part of a product or service offered to third parties, including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings; (c) is used by a for-profit organization in support of its commercial activities, including internal use that supports revenue-generating operations; or (d) involves incorporation of the Licensed Software into any product, service, or offering that is sold, licensed, or otherwise provided to customers or users for consideration.

**1.5. Developer** means Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi.

**1.6. Company** means The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated.

**1.7. Foundation** means UFasimba DiGiTal FrienDs.

**1.8. Contributor** means any individual or entity that has submitted a Contribution that has been accepted and merged into the Licensed Software and who has executed the Contributor License Agreement.

**1.9. Contribution** means any original work of authorship, including source code, documentation, bug fixes, feature enhancements, or other copyrightable material, that is submitted by a Contributor and accepted for inclusion in the Licensed Software.

**1.12. Royalty** means the percentage of Gross Revenue specified in Section 4 payable for Commercial Use, totaling twelve percent (12%).

**1.13. Gross Revenue** means the total revenue, receipts, or other consideration received by Licensee or its affiliates that is reasonably attributable to the Licensed Software, calculated before deductions for taxes, refunds, discounts, or expenses. Attribution shall be determined reasonably and in good faith by the parties based on the role and contribution of the Licensed Software to the revenue-generating activity.

## 2. License Grants

**2.1. Non-Commercial License Grant.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual (subject to termination provisions) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivative works of, and distribute the Licensed Software for Non-Commercial Use only. This grant includes the right to create and distribute derivative works for Non-Commercial Use, provided You retain all copyright notices and include a complete copy of this License with any distribution.

**2.2. Commercial Use Restricted.** Commercial Use of the Licensed Software is expressly not permitted under the Non-Commercial License Grant in Section 2.1. Any Commercial Use requires a separate written Commercial License from the Licensor and payment of Royalty as set forth in Section 4 below.

**2.3. Examples and Clarifications.** The following examples are illustrative and non-exhaustive:

**Permitted without Commercial License:** Personal hobby projects, classroom assignments and educational coursework, academic and scientific research published openly, internal experimentation and testing without commercial deployment, non-profit community projects that generate no revenue, open-source contributions and collaborative development for non-commercial purposes.

**Requires Commercial License and Royalty:** Use of the Licensed Software in a product sold or licensed to customers; embedding the Licensed Software in a commercial SaaS platform or cloud service; using the Licensed Software to provide commercial consulting, development, or managed services to third parties; incorporation into any for-profit product or service offering; internal use by a for-profit company where the Licensed Software supports or enables revenue-generating business operations or products.

**2.4. Preservation of License Terms.** All copies and derivative works of the Licensed Software distributed under Section 2.1 must include this complete License and preserve all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices.

## 3. Contributions and Contributor Grants

**3.1. Contributor License Agreement Required.** All Contributions from third parties are accepted only if the Contributor has executed the Voice & Eye Contributor License Agreement (VEO-CLA). The CLA grants the Licensor necessary rights to sublicense Contributions under this License and under separate Commercial Licenses, while establishing the Contributor's rights to participate in the Contributor Pool as specified in Section 4.6.

**3.2. Contributor Rights to Royalty Pool.** Contributors who have executed the CLA and whose Contributions have been accepted and merged into the Licensed Software become eligible to receive distributions from the Contributor Pool in proportion to their Contribution Value. These rights are non-transferable except as specified in Section 4.8.

**3.3. Contribution Acceptance.** The Licensor has sole discretion to accept or reject any Contribution. Acceptance of a Contribution does not create any employment, partnership, or agency relationship between the Contributor and the Licensor.

## 4. Commercial Licensing and Royalties

**4.1. Total Royalty Rate.** For any Commercial Use of the Licensed Software, Licensee must obtain a written Commercial License from the Licensor and shall pay a Royalty equal to twelve percent (12%) of Gross Revenue reasonably attributable to the Licensed Software.

**4.2. Royalty Allocation.** The twelve percent (12%) Royalty shall be allocated as follows:

- Three percent (3%) to Developer: Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi
- Three percent (3%) to Company: The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated
- Three percent (3%) to Foundation: UFasimba DiGiTal FrienDs
- Three percent (3%) to Contributor Pool: Distributed among all eligible Contributors in proportion to their Contribution Value

### **Total Royalty: Twelve percent (12%) of Gross Revenue**

**4.3. Gross Revenue Calculation.** Gross Revenue shall be calculated quarterly and shall include all revenue streams reasonably attributable to the Licensed Software, including but not limited to direct sales revenue, subscription fees, licensing fees, service fees, and any other monetary consideration received in connection with products or services that incorporate or depend upon the Licensed Software. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to determine reasonable attribution methodologies. In cases where the Licensed Software is one component of a larger product or service, attribution shall be based on the Licensed Software's functional contribution and importance to the overall offering.

**4.4. Payment Terms and Reporting.** Within thirty (30) days after the end of each fiscal quarter in which Licensee engages in Commercial Use, Licensee shall deliver to Licensor a written report containing:

- A calculation of Gross Revenue attributable to the Licensed Software for that quarter;
- A detailed breakdown showing the methodology used to attribute revenue to the Licensed Software;
- The calculated Royalty amount for each of the four beneficiaries (Developer, Company, Foundation, and Contributor Pool);
- Any other information reasonably necessary to verify the calculation.

Payment of the Royalty shall be made concurrently with submission of the quarterly report. Payments for Developer, Company, and Foundation shares shall be made directly to the designated bank accounts specified in Section 4.10 below. Payment of the Contributor Pool share shall be made to the Contributor Pool Account maintained by the Licensor for subsequent distribution to Contributors.

**4.5. Currency and Payment Methods.** Payments shall be made in either South African Rand (ZAR) or United States Dollars (USD) as agreed in the Commercial License. All payments must be made via international wire transfer, electronic funds transfer, or other verifiable payment method acceptable to the Licensor.

**4.6. Contributor Pool Distribution Methodology.** The Contributor Pool shall be distributed among eligible Contributors based on their proportional Contribution Value, calculated as follows:

**4.6.1. Contribution Value Calculation.** Each Contributor's Contribution Value is calculated using a weighted formula that considers multiple factors:

- **Lines of Code Contribution (40% weight):** Net lines of code added or meaningfully modified by the Contributor that remain in the current codebase, excluding auto-generated code, whitespace, and comments.

- **Commit Impact Score (30% weight):** A qualitative assessment of each commit's impact on functionality, architecture, performance, security, or user experience, rated on a scale and assigned by project maintainers during code review and acceptance.

- **Issue Resolution and Documentation (20% weight):** Credit for resolving filed issues, creating meaningful documentation, writing tests, and other non-code contributions that enhance the project's quality and usability.

- **Longevity Factor (10% weight):** A time-based multiplier that rewards Contributors whose code remains actively used in the codebase over multiple releases, calculated based on the duration their contributions have been incorporated.

**4.6.2. Calculation Period.** Contribution Value is calculated on a rolling twelve-month basis. Each quarter, the Contribution Value of all eligible Contributors is recalculated based on their contributions over the preceding twelve months. This ensures that the distribution reflects recent and sustained contribution patterns.

**4.6.3. Minimum Eligibility Threshold.** To be eligible for Contributor Pool distribution in any given quarter, a Contributor must have a Contribution Value that represents at least 0.5% of the total Contribution Value across all Contributors. This threshold prevents administrative burden of distributing very small amounts and encourages meaningful contributions.

**4.6.4. Individual Distribution Formula.** Each eligible Contributor's share of the Contributor Pool for a given quarter is calculated as:

Contributor Share = (Contributor's Contribution Value / Total Contribution Value of All Eligible Contributors) × Contributor Pool Amount for that Quarter

**4.6.5. Transparency and Record-Keeping.** The Licensor shall maintain detailed records of all Contribution Value calculations, including the factors used, the weights applied, and the resulting distributions. These records shall be made available to Contributors upon reasonable request. An automated dashboard showing current Contribution Value scores and estimated pool share shall be maintained and accessible to all Contributors who have executed the CLA.

**4.7. Contributor Pool Payment Schedule.** Distributions from the Contributor Pool shall be made quarterly, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of Commercial License royalty payments from Licensees. Contributors shall receive payment for their proportional share of the Contributor Pool accumulated during that quarter.

**4.8. Minimum Payment Threshold and Accumulation.** Individual Contributor payments below USD $50 (or ZAR equivalent) shall be held and accumulated until the Contributor's accumulated share reaches the minimum threshold. Accumulated amounts shall continue to accrue and shall be paid when the threshold is met or annually (whichever occurs first), provided the Contributor remains reachable and has provided valid payment information.

**4.9. Contributor Payment Information.** Contributors must provide valid payment information through the official Contributor Portal maintained by the Licensor. Acceptable payment methods include international wire transfer, PayPal, TransferWise (Wise), or other internationally accessible payment platforms. Contributors are responsible for any fees charged by their payment provider. Contributors are also responsible for understanding and complying with tax obligations in their jurisdiction regarding royalty income.

**4.10. Payment Instructions for Primary Beneficiaries.** Royalty payments for Developer, Company, and Foundation shares shall be made to the following designated accounts:

Audit Rights.** The Licensor may, not more than once per twelve (12) month period, engage an independent certified public accountant to audit Licensee's books, records, and systems concerning Gross Revenue attributable to the Licensed Software. Such audit shall be conducted upon at least thirty (30) days' advance written notice, during normal business hours, and at Licensor's expense. If any such audit discovers an underpayment of Royalty greater than five percent (5%) of the amount that should have been paid during the audited period, then in addition to paying the shortfall, Licensee shall reimburse Licensor for all reasonable costs and expenses of conducting the audit, including professional fees.

**4.12. Late Payment and Interest.** Any Royalty payment not made when due shall accrue interest from the due date until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of: (a) the statutory late payment interest rate under the governing law specified in Section 10; or (b) two percent (2%) per month, compounded monthly.
