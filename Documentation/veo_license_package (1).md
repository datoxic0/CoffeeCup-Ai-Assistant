## VOICE & EYE SOURCE-AVAILABLE NONCOMMERCIAL + COMMERCIAL-LICENSE (VEO-SA-NC-1.0)

Copyright (c) 2025 Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi and The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated

All rights reserved.

## Preamble

This License grants broad rights for non-commercial use of the software source code. Commercial and enterprise uses are permitted only under a separate commercial license that requires payment of royalties as described below. This License implements an equitable model that rewards not only the original developer and supporting organizations but also the community of contributors who enhance and improve the software. This License is a source-available license and not an OSI-approved open-source license because it reserves the right to require a commercial license and royalty payment for commercial and enterprise deployment.

## 1. Definitions

**1.1. Licensed Software** means the source code, binaries, documentation, and other materials expressly identified as being licensed under this License.

**1.2. You / Licensee** means any person or entity that exercises rights under this License.

**1.3. Non-Commercial Use** means use, reproduction, modification, distribution, or display of the Licensed Software that is not primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage, monetary compensation, or commercial deployment. Examples include personal projects, academic research, open research, non-profit activities, internal evaluation, and internal testing conducted without revenue generation.

**1.4. Commercial Use** means any use of the Licensed Software that: (a) is for or results in monetary compensation, revenue, fundraising, or other direct or indirect commercial advantage; (b) deploys the software in production as part of a product or service offered to third parties, including Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings; (c) is used by a for-profit organization in support of its commercial activities, including internal use that supports revenue-generating operations; or (d) involves incorporation of the Licensed Software into any product, service, or offering that is sold, licensed, or otherwise provided to customers or users for consideration.

**1.13. Gross Revenue** means the total revenue, receipts, or other consideration received by Licensee or its affiliates that is reasonably attributable to the Licensed Software, calculated before deductions for taxes, refunds, discounts, or expenses. Attribution shall be determined reasonably and in good faith by the parties based on the role and contribution of the Licensed Software to the revenue-generating activity.

## 2. License Grants

**2.1. Non-Commercial License Grant.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual (subject to termination provisions) license to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivative works of, and distribute the Licensed Software for Non-Commercial Use only.

**3.2. Contributor Rights to Royalty Pool.** Contributors who have executed the CLA and whose Contributions have been accepted and merged into the Licensed Software become eligible to receive distributions from the Contributor Pool in proportion to their Contribution Value. These rights are non-transferable except as specified in Section 4.8.

**3.3. Contribution Acceptance.** The Licensor has sole discretion to accept or reject any Contribution. Acceptance of a Contribution does not create any employment, partnership, or agency relationship between the Contributor and the Licensor.

## 4. Commercial Licensing and Royalties

**4.1. Total Royalty Rate.** For any Commercial Use of the Licensed Software, Licensee must obtain a written Commercial License from the Licensor and shall pay a Royalty equal to twelve percent (12%) of Gross Revenue reasonably attributable to the Licensed Software.

**4.2. Royalty Allocation.** The twelve percent (12%) Royalty shall be allocated as follows:

- Three percent (3%) to Developer: Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi
- Three percent (3%) to Company: The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated
- Three percent (3%) to Foundation: UFasimba DiGiTal FrienDs
- Three percent (3%) to Contributor Pool: Distributed among all eligible Contributors in proportion to their Contribution Value

### **Total Royalty: Twelve percent (12%) of Gross Revenue**

**4.3. Gross Revenue Calculation.** Gross Revenue shall be calculated quarterly and shall include all revenue streams reasonably attributable to the Licensed Software, including but not limited to direct sales revenue, subscription fees, licensing fees, service fees, and any other monetary consideration received in connection with products or services that incorporate or depend upon the Licensed Software. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to determine reasonable attribution methodologies. In cases where the Licensed Software is one component of a larger product or service, attribution shall be based on the Licensed Software's functional contribution and importance to the overall offering.

**4.4. Payment Terms and Reporting.** Within thirty (30) days after the end of each fiscal quarter in which Licensee engages in Commercial Use, Licensee shall deliver to Licensor a written report containing:

- A calculation of Gross Revenue attributable to the Licensed Software for that quarter;
- A detailed breakdown showing the methodology used to attribute revenue to the Licensed Software;
- The calculated Royalty amount for each of the four beneficiaries (Developer, Company, Foundation, and Contributor Pool);
- Any other information reasonably necessary to verify the calculation.

Payment of the Royalty shall be made concurrently with submission of the quarterly report. Payments for Developer, Company, and Foundation shares shall be made directly to the designated bank accounts specified in Section 4.10 below. Payment of the Contributor Pool share shall be made to the Contributor Pool Account maintained by the Licensor for subsequent distribution to Contributors.

**4.5. Currency and Payment Methods.** Payments shall be made in either South African Rand (ZAR) or United States Dollars (USD) as agreed in the Commercial License. All payments must be made via international wire transfer, electronic funds transfer, or other verifiable payment method acceptable to the Licensor.

**4.6. Contributor Pool Distribution Methodology.** The Contributor Pool shall be distributed among eligible Contributors based on their proportional Contribution Value, calculated as follows:

**4.6.1. Contribution Value Calculation.** Each Contributor's Contribution Value is calculated using a weighted formula that considers multiple factors:

- **Lines of Code Contribution (40% weight):** Net lines of code added or meaningfully modified by the Contributor that remain in the current codebase, excluding auto-generated code, whitespace, and comments.

- **Commit Impact Score (30% weight):** A qualitative assessment of each commit's impact on functionality, architecture, performance, security, or user experience, rated on a scale and assigned by project maintainers during code review and acceptance.

- **Issue Resolution and Documentation (20% weight):** Credit for resolving filed issues, creating meaningful documentation, writing tests, and other non-code contributions that enhance the project's quality and usability.

- **Longevity Factor (10% weight):** A time-based multiplier that rewards Contributors whose code remains actively used in the codebase over multiple releases, calculated based on the duration their contributions have been incorporated.

**4.6.2. Calculation Period.** Contribution Value is calculated on a rolling twelve-month basis. Each quarter, the Contribution Value of all eligible Contributors is recalculated based on their contributions over the preceding twelve months. This ensures that the distribution reflects recent and sustained contribution patterns.

**4.6.3. Minimum Eligibility Threshold.** To be eligible for Contributor Pool distribution in any given quarter, a Contributor must have a Contribution Value that represents at least 0.5% of the total Contribution Value across all Contributors. This threshold prevents administrative burden of distributing very small amounts and encourages meaningful contributions.

**4.6.4. Individual Distribution Formula.** Each eligible Contributor's share of the Contributor Pool for a given quarter is calculated as:

Contributor Share = (Contributor's Contribution Value / Total Contribution Value of All Eligible Contributors) × Contributor Pool Amount for that Quarter

**4.6.5. Transparency and Record-Keeping.** The Licensor shall maintain detailed records of all Contribution Value calculations, including the factors used, the weights applied, and the resulting distributions. These records shall be made available to Contributors upon reasonable request. An automated dashboard showing current Contribution Value scores and estimated pool share shall be maintained and accessible to all Contributors who have executed the CLA.

**4.7. Contributor Pool Payment Schedule.** Distributions from the Contributor Pool shall be made quarterly, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of Commercial License royalty payments from Licensees. Contributors shall receive payment for their proportional share of the Contributor Pool accumulated during that quarter.

**4.8. Minimum Payment Threshold and Accumulation.** Individual Contributor payments below USD $50 (or ZAR equivalent) shall be held and accumulated until the Contributor's accumulated share reaches the minimum threshold. Accumulated amounts shall continue to accrue and shall be paid when the threshold is met or annually (whichever occurs first), provided the Contributor remains reachable and has provided valid payment information.

**4.9. Contributor Payment Information.** Contributors must provide valid payment information through the official Contributor Portal maintained by the Licensor. Acceptable payment methods include international wire transfer, PayPal, TransferWise (Wise), or other internationally accessible payment platforms. Contributors are responsible for any fees charged by their payment provider. Contributors are also responsible for understanding and complying with tax obligations in their jurisdiction regarding royalty income.

**4.10. Payment Instructions for Primary Beneficiaries.** Royalty payments for Developer, Company, and Foundation shares shall be made to the following designated accounts:

**4.11. Audit Rights.** The Licensor may, not more than once per twelve (12) month period, engage an independent certified public accountant to audit Licensee's books, records, and systems concerning Gross Revenue attributable to the Licensed Software. Such audit shall be conducted upon at least thirty (30) days' advance written notice, during normal business hours, and at Licensor's expense. If any such audit discovers an underpayment of Royalty greater than five percent (5%) of the amount that should have been paid during the audited period, then in addition to paying the shortfall, Licensee shall reimburse Licensor for all reasonable costs and expenses of conducting the audit, including professional fees.

**4.12. Late Payment and Interest.** Any Royalty payment not made when due shall accrue interest from the due date until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of: (a) the statutory late payment interest rate under the governing law specified in Section 10; or (b) two percent (2%) per month, compounded monthly.

**4.13. Records Retention.** Licensee shall maintain complete and accurate books and records concerning all Gross Revenue calculations and Royalty payments for a period of at least five (5) years following the end of each fiscal year, and shall make such records available for audit in accordance with Section 4.11.

## DOCUMENT 2: PLAIN-ENGLISH COMMERCIAL LICENSING SUMMARY

## (Save this section as "COMMERCIAL-LICENSE-SUMMARY.md" in your repository)

---

## Commercial Licensing Summary

## Free for Personal and Educational Use

The software in this repository is completely free for personal, academic, and non-commercial projects. You can use it, modify it, and build with it without any payment or permission, as long as your use does not generate revenue or support commercial activities.

## Commercial Use Requires a License

If you are a business, startup, or organization that wants to use this software to support commercial operations, generate revenue, or deliver products or services to customers, you need to obtain a commercial license.

### What Counts as Commercial Use?

Commercial use includes any situation where the software contributes to business operations or revenue generation, such as building a product that you sell or license to customers, operating a SaaS platform or cloud service that uses this software, providing consulting or development services to clients using this software, using the software internally at a for-profit company to support business operations, or incorporating the software into any offering for which you receive payment.

### The Royalty Structure: A Fair and Ethical Model

When you use this software commercially, you pay a royalty of twelve percent (12%) of gross revenue reasonably attributable to the software. This royalty structure reflects our commitment to equitable value distribution across all stakeholders who contribute to the software's development and success. The royalty supports four distinct beneficiaries, each receiving three percent (3%):

**Developer (3%)** - Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi, the original creator, receives recognition and compensation for conceiving, architecting, and launching the project. This ensures the individual vision behind the software is rewarded.

**Company (3%)** - The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated receives support for ongoing development infrastructure, project management, quality assurance, marketing, legal compliance, and the operational overhead necessary to maintain a professional software project.

**Foundation (3%)** - UFasimba DiGiTal FrienDs receives dedicated funding to foster digital transformation and technology skills development across Africa. This portion directly supports educational initiatives, training programs, community technology access, and efforts to build sustainable digital ecosystems on the African continent.

**Contributor Pool (3%)** - All contributors who have submitted accepted code, documentation, bug fixes, or other meaningful improvements to the software share proportionally in this pool. Your commercial success directly rewards the community that enhances the software. This creates a unique incentive structure where contributors benefit financially when businesses succeed using their collective work.

The gross revenue calculation is based on the revenue your business earns from products or services that incorporate or depend on this software. The calculation is done quarterly, and we work with licensees in good faith to determine reasonable attribution when the software is one component of a larger offering.

### Why This Model Matters

This licensing approach serves multiple important objectives simultaneously. It ensures the software remains freely accessible for education, research, and personal projects, creating opportunities for learning and innovation without financial barriers. When the software creates commercial value for businesses, it generates sustainable funding for continued development, innovation, and improvement.

The contributor pool represents a fundamental commitment to ethical open development. Unlike traditional open-source models where contributors receive recognition but no financial reward, or proprietary models where only company owners benefit, this model ensures that everyone who improves the software shares in its commercial success. This alignment of incentives encourages high-quality contributions, attracts talented developers, and creates a sustainable ecosystem where commercial adoption directly funds community development.

The foundation component ensures that commercial success translates into social impact, particularly in advancing digital transformation across Africa. This creates a virtuous cycle where business adoption, technical improvement, and social benefit reinforce one another.

### How Contributors Benefit

If you contribute code, documentation, or other improvements to this project and your contributions are accepted, you automatically become eligible to participate in the Contributor Pool. Your share of the pool is calculated based on multiple factors including the amount and quality of code you contribute, the impact of your contributions on functionality and architecture, your creation of documentation and tests, and the longevity of your contributions in the active codebase.

The system uses a transparent formula that weights different types of contributions appropriately. Every quarter, when commercial licensees pay their royalties, the three percent allocated to the Contributor Pool is distributed among all eligible contributors based on their calculated contribution value over the preceding twelve months. This means active, high-quality contributors receive ongoing compensation as long as their work remains part of the software and commercial licensees continue generating revenue.

Contributors receive transparent access to a dashboard showing their current contribution value score and estimated pool share. Payments are made quarterly via international payment platforms, with minimum thresholds to ensure payment efficiency. The system is designed to be fair, transparent, and internationally accessible.

### How to Get a Commercial License

The process is straightforward and professionally managed. You contact us to discuss your intended use, and we provide a standard commercial license agreement that specifies payment terms, reporting requirements, and other practical details. The license typically covers a multi-year term with quarterly royalty payments based on your actual revenue attributable to the software.

We work collaboratively with licensees to establish clear attribution methodologies and reporting processes that fit their business model. For enterprise-scale deployments, we can negotiate terms including minimum annual guarantees, volume-based pricing adjustments, and enhanced support arrangements. Our goal is to create license terms that work for your business while maintaining the integrity of the royalty structure that supports the entire ecosystem.

### What You Get With a Commercial License

A commercial license provides several important benefits. You receive explicit legal permission to use the software for commercial purposes with full clarity and peace of mind. You can deploy the software in production environments serving customers without legal uncertainty. You gain access to standard commercial protections and terms appropriate for business use. You have the opportunity to negotiate support and service level agreements if needed for your operations. You become part of an ecosystem that demonstrably values and rewards innovation, technical excellence, and social impact.

### Payment and Reporting

Commercial licensees submit quarterly reports showing the gross revenue attributable to the software and the calculated royalty amount for each of the four beneficiaries. Payment is made in either South African Rand (ZAR) or United States Dollars (USD) to designated bank accounts. The Developer, Company, and Foundation receive their shares directly. The Contributor Pool share is paid into a dedicated account managed by the Licensor, which then distributes funds to individual contributors based on their calculated shares.

The reporting process is designed to be straightforward and transparent. We work collaboratively with licensees to establish clear methodologies for revenue attribution that are fair, auditable, and appropriate to their business model. Standard audit rights ensure compliance while respecting the confidentiality of commercial information.

### Evaluation and Assessment

If you are considering commercial use but want to evaluate the software first, we can arrange a limited evaluation period. This allows you to assess whether the software meets your technical and business requirements before committing to a commercial license. The evaluation period is structured to allow meaningful technical assessment while ensuring it does not constitute commercial deployment or revenue generation.

### Questions and Consultation

We understand that determining whether your use case requires a commercial license can sometimes involve nuanced considerations. We are available to discuss your specific situation and provide clarity about licensing requirements. Our goal is to ensure clarity and compliance while supporting both non-commercial innovation and sustainable commercial adoption.

We welcome discussions about how the software can meet your business needs, how the attribution methodology would apply to your specific use case, and how to structure a commercial license that works for both parties. We have experience working with startups, established enterprises, consulting firms, and SaaS providers, and we can tailor our commercial terms to different business models while maintaining the fundamental royalty structure.

Foundation: UFasimba DiGiTal FrienDs

### About the Foundation

UFasimba DiGiTal FrienDs is committed to fostering digital transformation and technical capability development across Africa. The foundation's share of commercial royalties supports initiatives that build digital skills, increase access to technology education, strengthen the technology ecosystem across the African continent, provide training and resources to underserved communities, support open technology initiatives, and create pathways for African developers and technologists to participate in the global digital economy.

When you obtain a commercial license for this software, you directly contribute to these mission-driven activities while building your own business capabilities. Your commercial success becomes a catalyst for social impact and expanded opportunity across an entire continent.

### A Model for Ethical Technology Development

This licensing structure represents a vision for how technology development can be conducted ethically and sustainably. It balances free access for learning and non-commercial innovation with fair compensation when commercial value is created. It ensures that everyone who contributes to the software's success shares in that success proportionally. It directs a meaningful portion of commercial revenue toward social impact and capacity building in regions that have historically been underrepresented in the global technology industry.

We believe this model demonstrates that commercial viability, community development, and social responsibility are not competing priorities but mutually reinforcing aspects of sustainable technology development. We welcome your participation in this ecosystem, whether as a user, contributor, commercial licensee, or advocate for ethical technology models.

## DOCUMENT 3: CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT (CLA)

## (Save this section as "CLA.md" and require contributors to sign)

---

## Voice & Eye Contributor License Agreement (VEO-CLA Version 2.0)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to software projects licensed under the Voice & Eye Source-Available NonCommercial + Commercial-License (VEO-SA-NC-1.0). This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") clarifies the intellectual property rights associated with contributions and establishes your rights to participate in the Contributor Pool, which provides financial compensation when the software generates commercial revenue.

## Purpose and Scope

This CLA applies to all contributions you submit to projects covered by the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License. By signing this CLA, you grant certain rights to the project maintainers while retaining your own copyright in your contributions and gaining the right to participate financially in the project's commercial success. This agreement is necessary to allow the project maintainers to distribute your contributions under both the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License for non-commercial use and under separate commercial licenses for commercial use, while ensuring you receive your proportional share of the Contributor Pool.

## Agreement

You accept and agree to the following terms for all contributions you have made or will make to the project. This is a legally binding agreement. Please read it carefully before signing.

### 1. Definitions

**"You" or "Your"** means the individual or legal entity submitting contributions under this CLA.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing work, that you submit to the project for inclusion in the software. This includes source code, documentation, configuration files, test files, bug fixes, feature implementations, architectural improvements, and any other copyrightable material.

**"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the project maintainers or their representatives, including but not limited to communication through source code management systems, pull requests, issue tracking systems, discussion forums, email, or any other medium controlled by or on behalf of the project.

**"Project"** means the software project maintained by Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi and The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated and licensed under the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License.

**"Maintainers"** means Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi, The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated, and any authorized representatives managing the project.

**"Contributor Pool"** means the fund representing three percent (3%) of gross revenue from commercial licensing, distributed among all Contributors in proportion to their Contribution Value as calculated under the License.

**"Contribution Value"** means the quantitative measure of your contribution to the Licensed Software, calculated using the methodology specified in Section 4.6 of the License.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms of this CLA, You hereby grant to the Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

This grant specifically includes the right for the Maintainers to distribute Your Contributions under the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License for non-commercial use and under separate commercial licenses for commercial use, including the collection of royalties as specified in the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms of this CLA, You hereby grant to the Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by combination of Your Contributions with the project to which such Contributions were submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity alleging that Your Contribution or the software to which You have contributed constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this CLA for that Contribution or software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 4. Contributor Pool Participation Rights

**4.1. Eligibility for Contributor Pool.** Upon acceptance and merging of Your Contributions into the project, You become eligible to participate in the Contributor Pool. This means You are entitled to receive a proportional share of the three percent (3%) of commercial licensing revenue allocated to the Contributor Pool, calculated based on Your Contribution Value relative to all other Contributors.

**4.2. Calculation of Your Share.** Your share of the Contributor Pool is calculated quarterly using the methodology specified in Section 4.6 of the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License. The calculation considers multiple weighted factors including lines of code contributed, impact and quality of contributions, documentation and testing contributions, and the longevity of your contributions in the active codebase. The calculation is performed on a rolling twelve-month basis, meaning Your share reflects Your contributions over the preceding twelve months.

**4.3. Transparency and Visibility.** You will have access to a Contributor Portal dashboard that shows Your current Contribution Value score, Your estimated proportional share of the Contributor Pool, and historical distribution data. The Maintainers commit to maintaining transparent records of all Contribution Value calculations and making these available to all Contributors.

**4.4. Payment Terms.** Distributions from the Contributor Pool are made quarterly, within forty-five (45) days after the Maintainers receive commercial license royalty payments. Payments below USD $50 (or ZAR equivalent) will be accumulated until the minimum threshold is reached or paid annually, whichever occurs first.

**4.5. Payment Information Requirement.** To receive Contributor Pool distributions, You must provide valid payment information through the official Contributor Portal. Acceptable payment methods include international wire transfer, PayPal, TransferWise (Wise), or other internationally accessible payment platforms approved by the Maintainers.

**4.6. Tax Responsibilities.** You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with tax obligations in Your jurisdiction regarding royalty income received from the Contributor Pool. The Maintainers may be required to report payments to tax authorities depending on jurisdiction and amount, and You agree to provide any tax documentation reasonably requested for compliance purposes.

**4.7. Duration of Rights.** Your rights to Contributor Pool distributions continue as long as Your Contributions remain part of the active codebase and commercial licenses generate revenue. Your Contribution Value is recalculated quarterly based on the current state of the codebase and Your contributions over the preceding twelve months. If Your contributions are removed from the codebase or become obsolete, Your Contribution Value will decrease accordingly in future calculations.

**4.8. No Guarantee of Revenue.** While You have the right to participate proportionally in the Contributor Pool, You acknowledge that the amount of commercial licensing revenue is uncertain and may vary significantly over time. There is no guarantee that commercial licenses will be sold or that the Contributor Pool will contain any particular amount in any given period.

### 5. Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that:

**5.1.** You are legally entitled to grant the licenses and rights set forth in this CLA. If Your employer or another entity has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that entity, or that Your employer or entity has waived such rights for Your Contributions to this project.

**5.2.** Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation and does not violate any third party's intellectual property rights. You have not copied code, documentation, or other materials from any source unless You have the legal right to do so and such use is compatible with the project's licensing.

**5.3.** Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

**5.4.** You provide Your Contributions on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including without limitation any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

**5.5.** You have the authority to enter into this CLA and, if You are entering into this CLA on behalf of an entity, You have the authority to bind that entity to these terms.

### 6. Retention of Copyright

You retain Your copyright in Your Contributions. The grants of rights in this CLA do not transfer ownership of Your Contributions to the Maintainers. You are free to use Your Contributions in other projects or contexts in accordance with Your own intellectual property rights. However, the grant of rights in this CLA is irrevocable and allows the Maintainers to continue using Your Contributions as specified herein, including licensing them commercially.

### 7. No Obligation to Use Contributions

You understand and agree that the Maintainers have no obligation to accept, use, or distribute Your Contributions. The decision to include any Contribution in the project is made at the sole discretion of the Maintainers. The Maintainers may modify, adapt, or combine Your Contributions with other code as they determine appropriate for the project. Rejection of a Contribution does not establish any Contributor Pool rights.

### 8. Contributions Made on Behalf of Others

If You are making Contributions on behalf of Your employer or another entity, You represent that You have authority to bind that entity to this CLA. In such cases, the terms "You" and "Your" in this CLA refer to both You as an individual and the entity on whose behalf You are acting. Contributor Pool distributions will be made to the designated payee specified in Your Contributor Portal profile, which may be either You individually or the entity You represent.

If You are employed by a company or organization, You should ensure that Your employer does not have a policy that would prevent You from entering into this CLA or that would claim rights to Contributor Pool distributions. Many employers claim rights to intellectual property created by their employees. You should clarify your employer's policy before signing this CLA.

### 9. Notification of Status Changes

You agree to notify the Maintainers in writing within thirty (30) days if any facts or circumstances would make Your representations in Section 5 inaccurate in any respect. This includes situations where You become aware that Your Contribution may infringe third-party rights, where Your employment or legal status changes in a way that affects Your ability to grant the rights in this CLA, or where Your contact or payment information changes.

### 10. Dispute Resolution

Any dispute arising out of or relating to this CLA, including disputes regarding Contribution Value calculations or pool distributions, shall first be subject to good faith negotiation between You and the Maintainers for thirty (30) days. If negotiation does not resolve the dispute, the parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation administered by a mutually agreed neutral third party before commencing any legal action.

### 11. Governing Law

This CLA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of South Africa, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.

### 12. Entire Agreement and Amendments

This CLA constitutes the entire agreement between You and the Maintainers concerning Your Contributions and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether oral or written. This CLA may be amended only by a written document signed by both You and the Maintainers, except that the Maintainers may update the Contribution Value calculation methodology specified in the License without amending individual CLAs, provided such updates are applied uniformly to all Contributors and do not reduce vested rights to distributions already earned.

### 13. Severability

If any provision of this CLA is held to be unenforceable or invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid provision with a valid provision that achieves the same purpose to the extent legally possible.

```javascript
function onFormSubmit(e) {
  // This function runs automatically when a new form is submitted
  
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  var submissionSheet = sheet.getSheetByName("CLA Submissions");
  var registrySheet = sheet.getSheetByName("Contributor Registry");
  
  // Get the last row (newest submission)
  var lastRow = submissionSheet.getLastRow();
  var submissionData = submissionSheet.getRange(lastRow, 1, 1, submissionSheet.getLastColumn()).getValues()[0];
  
  // Extract key data
  var timestamp = submissionData[0];
  var fullName = submissionData[1];
  var email = submissionData[2];
  var githubUsername = submissionData[3];
  var country = submissionData[4];
  var paymentMethod = submissionData[5];
  var paymentDetails = submissionData[6];
  var signature = submissionData[submissionData.length - 3]; // Electronic signature field
  
  // Validate signature matches name
  if (signature.toLowerCase() !== fullName.toLowerCase()) {
    // Send validation error email
    sendValidationErrorEmail(email, fullName);
    return;
  }
  
  // Generate Contributor ID
  var contributorID = generateContributorID(timestamp);
  
  // Add to Contributor Registry
  registrySheet.appendRow([
    contributorID,
    Utilities.formatDate(new Date(timestamp), Session.getScriptTimeZone(), "yyyy-MM-dd"),
    fullName,
    email,
    githubUsername,
    country,
    paymentMethod,
    "***ENCRYPTED***", // In production, encrypt or reference secure storage
    "Active",
    "", // First contribution date - to be filled when first commit detected
    "", // Last contribution date
    0, // Total commits
    "No", // Portal access granted
    "", // Portal email sent date
    "CLA signed on " + Utilities.formatDate(new Date(timestamp), Session.getScriptTimeZone(), "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")
  ]);
  
  // Send confirmation email
  sendCLAConfirmationEmail(email, fullName, contributorID);
  
  // Log to admin
  Logger.log("New CLA processed: " + contributorID + " - " + fullName);
}

function generateContributorID(timestamp) {
  var date = new Date(timestamp);
  var year = date.getFullYear();
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("Contributor Registry");
  var lastRow = sheet.getLastRow();
  var sequenceNumber = String(lastRow).padStart(4, '0');
  return "CONTRIB-" + year + "-" + sequenceNumber;
}

function sendCLAConfirmationEmail(email, name, contributorID) {
  var subject = "CLA Accepted - Welcome to the Voice & Eye Contributor Community";
  var body = `Dear ${name},

Thank you for signing the Voice & Eye Contributor License Agreement (VEO-CLA Version 2.0)!

Your CLA has been successfully processed and accepted.

**Your Contributor Details:**
- Contributor ID: ${contributorID}
- CLA Acceptance Date: ${Utilities.formatDate(new Date(), Session.getScriptTimeZone(), "yyyy-MM-dd")}
- Email: ${email}

**Next Steps:**

1. **Start Contributing:** You can now submit pull requests to the project. Your contributions will be tracked and will contribute to your Contribution Value score.

2. **Contributor Portal Access:** Within 48 hours, you will receive a separate email with credentials to access the Contributor Portal dashboard, where you can view:
   - Your current Contribution Value score
   - Your estimated share of the Contributor Pool
   - Historical contribution tracking
   - Payment information and distribution history

3. **Set Up Payment Information:** Once you receive portal access, please verify your payment information is correct in your profile.

**Understanding the Contributor Pool:**

You are now eligible to participate in the Contributor Pool, which represents 3% of all commercial licensing revenue. Your share is calculated quarterly based on your Contribution Value over the preceding 12 months, considering:
- Code contributions (lines and quality)
- Impact of your commits on functionality and architecture
- Documentation and testing contributions
- Longevity of your contributions in the active codebase

The more valuable your contributions, the larger your share of the pool. Contribution Value is calculated transparently using a weighted formula, and you'll be able to track your score in real-time through the portal.

**Important Reminders:**

- There is no guarantee of specific revenue amounts; pool distributions depend on commercial licensing activity
- You are responsible for tax obligations on any income received
- Keep your contact and payment information up to date in the portal
- Your CLA covers all future contributions unless your legal status changes significantly

### Step 4: Set Up Automated Triggers

**In Apps Script Editor (Extensions > Apps Script):**

1. Click on the clock icon (Triggers) in the left sidebar
2. Click "+ Add Trigger"

**Create the following triggers:**

### **Trigger 1: Form Submission Processing**

- Choose function: `onFormSubmit`
- Choose deployment: Head
- Select event source: From spreadsheet
- Select event type: On form submit
- Failure notification: Notify me immediately

### **Trigger 2: Quarterly Calculation (Optional Automation)**

- Choose function: `calculateQuarterlyContributionValues`
- Choose deployment: Head
- Select event source: Time-driven
- Select type: Month timer
- Select day: First day of the month
- Select time: 1am to 2am
- Failure notification: Notify me daily

---

## Part 2: Microsoft Forms Implementation (Alternative)

### Step 1: Create Microsoft Form

**Create a new form in Microsoft Forms with the same structure as the Google Form above.**

**Key differences:**

- Microsoft Forms has similar question types
- Use branching logic for conditional questions (organization details)
- Enable "One response per person" setting
- Collect email automatically

### Step 2: Connect to Google Sheets via Power Automate

**Create a Power Automate flow:**

1. **Trigger:** When a new response is submitted (Microsoft Forms)
2. **Action:** Get response details (Microsoft Forms)
3. **Action:** Add a row to Google Sheets
   - Select your Google Sheets file
   - Map form fields to spreadsheet columns
4. **Action:** Send email notification (use same template as Google Apps Script version)

**Flow Configuration:**

```bash
Trigger: Microsoft Forms - When a new response is submitted
  └─> Get response details
      └─> Add row (Google Sheets)
          └─> Send email (Office 365 Outlook or Gmail)
              └─> [Optional] Create item in SharePoint list for compliance tracking
```

## Part 3: Data Security and Compliance Considerations

### Security Best Practices

**1. Sensitive Data Handling:**

- Do NOT store full payment account details in plain text
- Use encrypted references or secure credential storage services
- Consider using Google Cloud Secret Manager or Azure Key Vault for payment credentials
- Implement row-level access controls in Google Sheets

**2. Access Control:**

- Limit spreadsheet edit access to designated administrators only
- Contributors should only see their own data (implement portal with filtered views)
- Use Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 admin controls
- Enable 2-factor authentication for all admin accounts

**3. Backup and Audit Trail:**

- Enable version history in Google Sheets
- Set up automatic daily backups to Google Drive or Azure Blob Storage
- Log all automated actions and manual changes
- Keep CLA submissions for at least 7 years for legal compliance

**4. GDPR and Privacy Compliance:**

- Add privacy notice to forms explaining data usage
- Implement data retention and deletion policies
- Allow contributors to request data export or deletion
- Document your data processing activities

**5. Email Security:**

- Use domain authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- Consider using transactional email service (SendGrid, Mailgun) for professional delivery
- Never include sensitive payment details in emails

### Legal Validity of Electronic Signatures

**The electronic signature collection method is legally valid under:**

- United States: E-SIGN Act (2000)
- European Union: eIDAS Regulation
- South Africa: Electronic Communications and Transactions Act (ECTA)
- Most other jurisdictions with similar electronic signature legislation

**Requirements for validity:**

- Intent to sign (confirmed by checkboxes)
- Consent to electronic transaction (form submission implies consent)
- Association with the record (timestamp and email linkage)
- Record retention (automatic in spreadsheet)

---

## Part 4: Contributor Portal (Future Development)

### Recommended Portal Features

**Authentication:**

- Email-based magic link login (no password required)
- Integration with GitHub OAuth for contributor verification

**Dashboard Views:**

- Current Contribution Value score with breakdown
- Rolling 12-month contribution graph
- Estimated quarterly pool share calculator
- Historical distributions table
- Payment information management
- Tax document downloads

**Technology Stack Suggestions:**

- **Frontend:** React or Next.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express or serverless functions (Google Cloud Functions/AWS Lambda)
- **Database:** Continue using Google Sheets as backend (via Google Sheets API) or migrate to PostgreSQL/Firebase
- **Authentication:** Auth0, Firebase Auth, or custom JWT implementation
- **Hosting:** Vercel, Netlify, or Google Cloud Run

## Part 5: Git Integration for Contribution Tracking

### Automated Contribution Data Collection

**To automatically populate the "Contribution Tracking" sheet:**

#### Method 1: GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/contribution-tracking.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Contribution Tracking

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0' # Run weekly on Sunday at midnight
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  track-contributions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history
      
      - name: Analyze contributions
        run: |
          # Generate contribution statistics
          git log --since="3 months ago" --pretty=format:"%ae" --numstat | \
          awk '{if (NF == 3) {added[$3]+=$1; deleted[$3]+=$2}} END {for (author in added) print author, added[author], deleted[author]}' \
          > contribution-stats.txt
      
      - name: Update Google Sheets
        env:
          GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS }}
          SPREADSHEET_ID: ${{ secrets.SPREADSHEET_ID }}
        run: |
          # Use Google Sheets API to update tracking data
          python update-contribution-tracking.py
```

#### Method 2: Manual Quarterly Git Analysis

**Run these Git commands quarterly to collect data:**

```bash
# Get contribution stats for past 12 months
git log --since="12 months ago" --pretty=format:"%ae" --numstat | \
awk '{if (NF == 3) {added[$3]+=$1; deleted[$3]+=$2; files[$3]++}} 
     END {for (author in added) 
       printf "%s,%d,%d,%d\n", author, added[author], deleted[author], files[author]}' \
> quarterly-contributions.csv

# Get commit impact scores (requires manual review)
git log --since="12 months ago" --pretty=format:"%ae|%h|%s" > commits-for-review.txt

# Get issue resolution data (if using GitHub)
gh issue list --state closed --assignee @me --json number,title,closedAt --search "closed:>=$(date -d '12 months ago' +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

**Then manually:**

1. Import quarterly-contributions.csv into "Contribution Tracking" sheet
2. Assign impact scores to commits (review commits-for-review.txt)
3. Add issue resolution data
4. Calculate longevity factors based on code still in main branch

````markdown
# Contributing to [Project Name]

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project operates under an innovative licensing model where contributors can earn financial compensation when the software generates commercial revenue.

## Before You Contribute

All contributors must sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before their first contribution can be merged. The CLA:
- Grants necessary rights for us to license your contributions
- Establishes your rights to participate in the Contributor Pool
- Takes only 2-3 minutes to complete online

## Sign the CLA

**Option 1: Google Forms (Recommended)**
[INSERT GOOGLE FORMS URL HERE]

**Option 2: Microsoft Forms**
[INSERT MICROSOFT FORMS URL HERE]
