## Commercial Licensing Summary

## Free for Personal and Educational Use

The software in this repository is completely free for personal, academic, and non-commercial projects. You can use it, modify it, and build with it without any payment or permission, as long as your use does not generate revenue or support commercial activities.

## Commercial Use Requires a License

If you are a business, startup, or organization that wants to use this software to support commercial operations, generate revenue, or deliver products or services to customers, you need to obtain a commercial license.

### What Counts as Commercial Use?

Commercial use includes any situation where the software contributes to business operations or revenue generation, such as building a product that you sell or license to customers, operating a SaaS platform or cloud service that uses this software, providing consulting or development services to clients using this software, using the software internally at a for-profit company to support business operations, or incorporating the software into any offering for which you receive payment.

### The Royalty Structure: A Fair and Ethical Model

When you use this software commercially, you pay a royalty of twelve percent (12%) of gross revenue reasonably attributable to the software. This royalty structure reflects our commitment to equitable value distribution across all stakeholders who contribute to the software's development and success. The royalty supports four distinct beneficiaries, each receiving three percent (3%):

**Developer (3%)** - Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi, the original creator, receives recognition and compensation for conceiving, architecting, and launching the project. This ensures the individual vision behind the software is rewarded.

**Company (3%)** - The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated receives support for ongoing development infrastructure, project management, quality assurance, marketing, legal compliance, and the operational overhead necessary to maintain a professional software project.

**Foundation (3%)** - UFasimba DiGiTal FrienDs receives dedicated funding to foster digital transformation and technology skills development across Africa. This portion directly supports educational initiatives, training programs, community technology access, and efforts to build sustainable digital ecosystems on the African continent.

**Contributor Pool (3%)** - All contributors who have submitted accepted code, documentation, bug fixes, or other meaningful improvements to the software share proportionally in this pool. Your commercial success directly rewards the community that enhances the software. This creates a unique incentive structure where contributors benefit financially when businesses succeed using their collective work.

The gross revenue calculation is based on the revenue your business earns from products or services that incorporate or depend on this software. The calculation is done quarterly, and we work with licensees in good faith to determine reasonable attribution when the software is one component of a larger offering.

### Why This Model Matters

This licensing approach serves multiple important objectives simultaneously. It ensures the software remains freely accessible for education, research, and personal projects, creating opportunities for learning and innovation without financial barriers. When the software creates commercial value for businesses, it generates sustainable funding for continued development, innovation, and improvement.

The contributor pool represents a fundamental commitment to ethical open development. Unlike traditional open-source models where contributors receive recognition but no financial reward, or proprietary models where only company owners benefit, this model ensures that everyone who improves the software shares in its commercial success. This alignment of incentives encourages high-quality contributions, attracts talented developers, and creates a sustainable ecosystem where commercial adoption directly funds community development.

The foundation component ensures that commercial success translates into social impact, particularly in advancing digital transformation across Africa. This creates a virtuous cycle where business adoption, technical improvement, and social benefit reinforce one another.

### How Contributors Benefit

If you contribute code, documentation, or other improvements to this project and your contributions are accepted, you automatically become eligible to participate in the Contributor Pool. Your share of the pool is calculated based on multiple factors including the amount and quality of code you contribute, the impact of your contributions on functionality and architecture, your creation of documentation and tests, and the longevity of your contributions in the active codebase.

The system uses a transparent formula that weights different types of contributions appropriately. Every quarter, when commercial licensees pay their royalties, the three percent allocated to the Contributor Pool is distributed among all eligible contributors based on their calculated contribution value over the preceding twelve months. This means active, high-quality contributors receive ongoing compensation as long as their work remains part of the software and commercial licensees continue generating revenue.

Contributors receive transparent access to a dashboard showing their current contribution value score and estimated pool share. Payments are made quarterly via international payment platforms, with minimum thresholds to ensure payment efficiency. The system is designed to be fair, transparent, and internationally accessible.

### How to Get a Commercial License

The process is straightforward and professionally managed. You contact us to discuss your intended use, and we provide a standard commercial license agreement that specifies payment terms, reporting requirements, and other practical details. The license typically covers a multi-year term with quarterly royalty payments based on your actual revenue attributable to the software.

We work collaboratively with licensees to establish clear attribution methodologies and reporting processes that fit their business model. For enterprise-scale deployments, we can negotiate terms including minimum annual guarantees, volume-based pricing adjustments, and enhanced support arrangements. Our goal is to create license terms that work for your business while maintaining the integrity of the royalty structure that supports the entire ecosystem.

### What You Get With a Commercial License

A commercial license provides several important benefits. You receive explicit legal permission to use the software for commercial purposes with full clarity and peace of mind. You can deploy the software in production environments serving customers without legal uncertainty. You gain access to standard commercial protections and terms appropriate for business use. You have the opportunity to negotiate support and service level agreements if needed for your operations. You become part of an ecosystem that demonstrably values and rewards innovation, technical excellence, and social impact.

### Payment and Reporting

Commercial licensees submit quarterly reports showing the gross revenue attributable to the software and the calculated royalty amount for each of the four beneficiaries. Payment is made in either South African Rand (ZAR) or United States Dollars (USD) to designated bank accounts. The Developer, Company, and Foundation receive their shares directly. The Contributor Pool share is paid into a dedicated account managed by the Licensor, which then distributes funds to individual contributors based on their calculated shares.

The reporting process is designed to be straightforward and transparent. We work collaboratively with licensees to establish clear methodologies for revenue attribution that are fair, auditable, and appropriate to their business model. Standard audit rights ensure compliance while respecting the confidentiality of commercial information.

### Evaluation and Assessment

If you are considering commercial use but want to evaluate the software first, we can arrange a limited evaluation period. This allows you to assess whether the software meets your technical and business requirements before committing to a commercial license. The evaluation period is structured to allow meaningful technical assessment while ensuring it does not constitute commercial deployment or revenue generation.

### Questions and Consultation

We understand that determining whether your use case requires a commercial license can sometimes involve nuanced considerations. We are available to discuss your specific situation and provide clarity about licensing requirements. Our goal is to ensure clarity and compliance while supporting both non-commercial innovation and sustainable commercial adoption.

We welcome discussions about how the software can meet your business needs, how the attribution methodology would apply to your specific use case, and how to structure a commercial license that works for both parties. We have experience working with startups, established enterprises, consulting firms, and SaaS providers, and we can tailor our commercial terms to different business models while maintaining the fundamental royalty structure.

When you obtain a commercial license for this software, you directly contribute to these mission-driven activities while building your own business capabilities. Your commercial success becomes a catalyst for social impact and expanded opportunity across an entire continent.

### A Model for Ethical Technology Development

This licensing structure represents a vision for how technology development can be conducted ethically and sustainably. It balances free access for learning and non-commercial innovation with fair compensation when commercial value is created. It ensures that everyone who contributes to the software's success shares in that success proportionally. It directs a meaningful portion of commercial revenue toward social impact and capacity building in regions that have historically been underrepresented in the global technology industry.

We believe this model demonstrates that commercial viability, community development, and social responsibility are not competing priorities but mutually reinforcing aspects of sustainable technology development. We welcome your participation in this ecosystem, whether as a user, contributor, commercial licensee, or advocate for ethical technology models.
