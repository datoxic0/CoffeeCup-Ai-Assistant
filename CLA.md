## Voice & Eye Contributor License Agreement (VEO-CLA-1.0)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to software projects licensed under the Voice & Eye Source-Available NonCommercial + Commercial-License (VEO-SA-NC-1.0). This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") clarifies the intellectual property rights associated with contributions and establishes your rights to participate in the Contributor Pool, which provides financial compensation when the software generates commercial revenue.

## Purpose and Scope

This CLA applies to all contributions you submit to projects covered by the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License. By signing this CLA, you grant certain rights to the project maintainers while retaining your own copyright in your contributions and gaining the right to participate financially in the project's commercial success. This agreement is necessary to allow the project maintainers to distribute your contributions under both the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License for non-commercial use and under separate commercial licenses for commercial use, while ensuring you receive your proportional share of the Contributor Pool.

## Agreement

You accept and agree to the following terms for all contributions you have made or will make to the project. This is a legally binding agreement. Please read it carefully before signing.

### 1. Definitions

**"You" or "Your"** means the individual or legal entity submitting contributions under this CLA.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing work, that you submit to the project for inclusion in the software. This includes source code, documentation, configuration files, test files, bug fixes, feature implementations, architectural improvements, and any other copyrightable material.

**"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the project maintainers or their representatives, including but not limited to communication through source code management systems, pull requests, issue tracking systems, discussion forums, email, or any other medium controlled by or on behalf of the project.

**"Project"** means the software project maintained by Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi and The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated and licensed under the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License.

**"Maintainers"** means Siyabonga Blessing Phakathi, The Voice and Eye of Bhambatha Incorporated, and any authorized representatives managing the project.

**"Contributor Pool"** means the fund representing three percent (3%) of gross revenue from commercial licensing, distributed among all Contributors in proportion to their Contribution Value as calculated under the License.

**"Contribution Value"** means the quantitative measure of your contribution to the Licensed Software, calculated using the methodology specified in Section 4.6 of the License.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms of this CLA, You hereby grant to the Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

This grant specifically includes the right for the Maintainers to distribute Your Contributions under the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License for non-commercial use and under separate commercial licenses for commercial use, including the collection of royalties as specified in the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms of this CLA, You hereby grant to the Maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by combination of Your Contributions with the project to which such Contributions were submitted.

If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity alleging that Your Contribution or the software to which You have contributed constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this CLA for that Contribution or software shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 4. Contributor Pool Participation Rights

**4.1. Eligibility for Contributor Pool.** Upon acceptance and merging of Your Contributions into the project, You become eligible to participate in the Contributor Pool. This means You are entitled to receive a proportional share of the three percent (3%) of commercial licensing revenue allocated to the Contributor Pool, calculated based on Your Contribution Value relative to all other Contributors.

**4.2. Calculation of Your Share.** Your share of the Contributor Pool is calculated quarterly using the methodology specified in Section 4.6 of the VEO-SA-NC-1.0 License. The calculation considers multiple weighted factors including lines of code contributed, impact and quality of contributions, documentation and testing contributions, and the longevity of your contributions in the active codebase. The calculation is performed on a rolling twelve-month basis, meaning Your share reflects Your contributions over the preceding twelve months.

**4.3. Transparency and Visibility.** You will have access to a Contributor Portal dashboard that shows Your current Contribution Value score, Your estimated proportional share of the Contributor Pool, and historical distribution data. The Maintainers commit to maintaining transparent records of all Contribution Value calculations and making these available to all Contributors.

**4.4. Payment Terms.** Distributions from the Contributor Pool are made quarterly, within forty-five (45) days after the Maintainers receive commercial license royalty payments. Payments below USD $50 (or ZAR equivalent) will be accumulated until the minimum threshold is reached or paid annually, whichever occurs first.

**4.5. Payment Information Requirement.** To receive Contributor Pool distributions, You must provide valid payment information through the official Contributor Portal. Acceptable payment methods include international wire transfer, PayPal, TransferWise (Wise), or other internationally accessible payment platforms approved by the Maintainers.

**4.6. Tax Responsibilities.** You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with tax obligations in Your jurisdiction regarding royalty income received from the Contributor Pool. The Maintainers may be required to report payments to tax authorities depending on jurisdiction and amount, and You agree to provide any tax documentation reasonably requested for compliance purposes.

**4.7. Duration of Rights.** Your rights to Contributor Pool distributions continue as long as Your Contributions remain part of the active codebase and commercial licenses generate revenue. Your Contribution Value is recalculated quarterly based on the current state of the codebase and Your contributions over the preceding twelve months. If Your contributions are removed from the codebase or become obsolete, Your Contribution Value will decrease accordingly in future calculations.

**4.8. No Guarantee of Revenue.** While You have the right to participate proportionally in the Contributor Pool, You acknowledge that the amount of commercial licensing revenue is uncertain and may vary significantly over time. There is no guarantee that commercial licenses will be sold or that the Contributor Pool will contain any particular amount in any given period.

### 5. Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that:

**5.1.** You are legally entitled to grant the licenses and rights set forth in this CLA. If Your employer or another entity has rights to intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that entity, or that Your employer or entity has waived such rights for Your Contributions to this project.

**5.2.** Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation and does not violate any third party's intellectual property rights. You have not copied code, documentation, or other materials from any source unless You have the legal right to do so and such use is compatible with the project's licensing.

**5.3.** Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

**5.4.** You provide Your Contributions on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including without limitation any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

**5.5.** You have the authority to enter into this CLA and, if You are entering into this CLA on behalf of an entity, You have the authority to bind that entity to these terms.

### 6. Retention of Copyright

You retain Your copyright in Your Contributions. The grants of rights in this CLA do not transfer ownership of Your Contributions to the Maintainers. You are free to use Your Contributions in other projects or contexts in accordance with Your own intellectual property rights. However, the grant of rights in this CLA is irrevocable and allows the Maintainers to continue using Your Contributions as specified herein, including licensing them commercially.

### 7. No Obligation to Use Contributions

You understand and agree that the Maintainers have no obligation to accept, use, or distribute Your Contributions. The decision to include any Contribution in the project is made at the sole discretion of the Maintainers. The Maintainers may modify, adapt, or combine Your Contributions with other code as they determine appropriate for the project. Rejection of a Contribution does not establish any Contributor Pool rights.

### 8. Contributions Made on Behalf of Others

If You are making Contributions on behalf of Your employer or another entity, You represent that You have authority to bind that entity to this CLA. In such cases, the terms "You" and "Your" in this CLA refer to both You as an individual and the entity on whose behalf You are acting. Contributor Pool distributions will be made to the designated payee specified in Your Contributor Portal profile, which may be either You individually or the entity You represent.

If You are employed by a company or organization, You should ensure that Your employer does not have a policy that would prevent You from entering into this CLA or that would claim rights to Contributor Pool distributions. Many employers claim rights to intellectual property created by their employees. You should clarify your employer's policy before signing this CLA.

### 9. Notification of Status Changes

You agree to notify the Maintainers in writing within thirty (30) days if any facts or circumstances would make Your representations in Section 5 inaccurate in any respect. This includes situations where You become aware that Your Contribution may infringe third-party rights, where Your employment or legal status changes in a way that affects Your ability to grant the rights in this CLA, or where Your contact or payment information changes.

### 10. Dispute Resolution

Any dispute arising out of or relating to this CLA, including disputes regarding Contribution Value calculations or pool distributions, shall first be subject to good faith negotiation between You and the Maintainers for thirty (30) days. If negotiation does not resolve the dispute, the parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation administered by a mutually agreed neutral third party before commencing any legal action.

### 11. Governing Law

This CLA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of South Africa, without regard to its conflicts of law principles.

### 12. Entire Agreement and Amendments

This CLA constitutes the entire agreement between You and the Maintainers concerning Your Contributions and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, whether oral or written. This CLA may be amended only by a written document signed by both You and the Maintainers, except that the Maintainers may update the Contribution Value calculation methodology specified in the License without amending individual CLAs, provided such updates are applied uniformly to all Contributors and do not reduce vested rights to distributions already earned.

### 13. Severability

If any provision of this CLA is held to be unenforceable or invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid provision with a valid provision that achieves the same purpose to the extent legally possible.
